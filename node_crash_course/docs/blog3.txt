we cannont run js directly on the computer but we can run it on the browser (as there is v8 engine written in c++ in browser )
V8 engine compiles javascript into machine code
but it cannot run outside browser because there is no v8 engine outside browser
to solve this
node comes into play
node.js also written in c++ that wraps the v8 engine
due to which we can now run js on computer as well as servers
.. node :  read and write files on computer
           connect to a database
           Act as as a server for content
           

installing node js 
cmd : node -v (will give version of your node ie v18.17.1)
using vs code as a text editor rather than node comand prompt
type:  node 
return ->( Welcome to Node.js v18.17.1.)
(To exit, press Ctrl+C again or Ctrl+D or type .exit)
cd documents
cd tuts
mkdir node_crash_course
cd node_crash_course
code .

in the terminal:
node test(<-- file name whose output you wanna see)

in browser we have global object window but not in node 

node <filename>  ----> to get output in powershell
clear (to clean powershell)
